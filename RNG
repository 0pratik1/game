List of every aspect affected by RNG in the game

1. The directional pad. 
  - Each direction goes 1-4 tiles at equal probabilities.
2. Speed changing tiles. 
  - These tiles can either increase or decrease tile movement by 1 tile at equal probabilities.
3. Saved from battle. 
  - 1% chance that when the player engages in battle the enemy flees.
4. Elite chance. 
  - 5% probability of an "elite" version of the enemy, which has increased stats explained later on.
5. First move. 
  - The player and enemy are equally likely (50-50) to attack first in battle.
6. Movesets. 
  - The player and enemy get 4 random moves chosen out of a large pool each turn, with 4 categories of moves to choose from. 
7. Running from battle. 
  - There's a 7% chance to run from battle if the player attempts to. Can only attempt to run once per battle.
8. Accuracy. 
  - The player and enemy have an accuracy attribute when they use moves. Currently, the player's default accuracy is 85% but
  that may change with buffs or items. The enemy's default accuracy is 95% but can change with debuffs.
9. Random battle buffs. 
  - There are 3 (so far; might add more) battle buffs: Distract-lowers enemy accuracy, Focus-next move never misses,
  and Intimidate-increases player damage all for one turn only. The player randomly gets 1 of 3 and can use it once per battle.
10. Damage
  - Damage of a move is randomly generated from the damage range of the move. Enemy stats, including damage, are scaled randomly
  in approximation to the player's power level. An "elite" version of an enemy will have around 1.5 +- 0.3 times the stats of a 
  normal enemy.
11. Critical strikes.
  - One category of moves are crit moves, which deal the least flat damage, but have a set chance to critically strike, dealing 
  (currently) 3x the normal damage, making it the most damaging category of moves if successful. 
12. Items.
  - Tiers of rarity: common, rare, epic, legendary
    - 60% chance for common, 25% chance for rare, 10% for epic, 5% for legendary
  - Regular enemies have a 40% chance to drop an item from the item pool (made up of 10 categories of items)
  - "Elite" enemies have a 60% chance to drop an item with rarity guaranteed greater than 0 (60% rare, 30% epic, 10% legendary)
  - Bosses have a 80% chance to drop an item with rarity guaranteed greater than 1 (70% epic, 30% legendary)
13. Enchanting items.
  - There is a 40% that an enchant will be a success and the equip has its stats (except accuracy) upgraded.
  - If the enchanting fails, there is a 60% chance that the item will be completely destroyed and removed from the inventory.
  - If not destroyed, the item retains its enchanted stats and is able to be enchanted again.
  - The amount of additional stats that enchanting gives depends on an item's rarity: the higher the rarity the greater 
  - the additional stats between each enchant.
  - An enchant randomly multiplies an item's stats between 1.0 and 1.6 depending on rarity.
14. Revival.
  - 1% chance after either the player or enemy takes fatal damage, they are revived with full hp
15. Experience.
  - EXP growth in the game is based on a set formula plus a random offset from level 1. Enemies also give exp from a set formula 
  based on level but give a random amount of extra EXP. When the player levels up, there is a random increase of stats in a range.
16. Battle transitions.
  - There are 6 (maybe more in the future) different transitions screens possible when entering and leaving battle.
17. Bosses.
  - Bosses have their own special random moveset in the theme of their characters.
